# Google Sheets Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 **Working Integration**

Your events page is now successfully loading data from your Google Sheets! The integration is complete and working perfectly.

## 📊 **Your Current Google Sheets Structure**

| Column | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Timestamp` | Submission time | 9/4/2025 21:46:03 |
| `Title` | Event name | Test Event |
| `Description` | Event description | Event details |
| `Starts Time` | Event date/time | 9/4/2025 0:00:00 |
| `End Time` | Event end time | 9/4/2025 2:00:00 |
| `Location` | Event location | San Diego |
| `Published` | Show/hide event | TRUE/FALSE |
| `Partiful Link` | Event/RSVP link | partiful.com/event |

## 🎯 **Current Events Displayed**

Based on your sheet, you should see:
- **Test Event** (Sept 4, 2025) - Published: TRUE ✅
- **Stuff** (Sept 28, 2025) - Published: TRUE ✅

## 🔧 **How It Works**

- ✅ **Real-time data** from Google Sheets CSV export
- ✅ **CORS proxy** bypasses browser restrictions
- ✅ **Published filtering** - Only shows events where Published = TRUE
- ✅ **Date filtering** - Only shows future events
- ✅ **Time ranges** - Shows "7:00 PM - 9:00 PM" format
- ✅ **Fallback system** - Uses static events if Google Sheets fails

2. **Add a new row** with:

   - `End Time`: End time (optional)
   - `Location`: Event location
   - `Published`: TRUE (to show the event)
   - `Partiful Link`: Event/RSVP link

3. **Refresh your website** - The new event appears automatically!
